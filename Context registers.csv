101,"Trench 1. Topsoil: dark brown-black, homogenous, peaty soil. Friable with rare inclusions of quartz and local slate up to 50mm in size. Contained lithics, a modern horseshoe and fragments of tire rubber."
102,"Trench 1. Natural substrate: mottled, heterogeneous, grey-white clay-silt containing abundant poorly-sorted stone fragments of weathered slate and sandstone up to 0.2m in size. Colour becomes mottled orange-brown around 40mm below surface. Colour is probably result of podsolization processes."
201,"Trench 2. Topsoil: dark brown/black, homogenous, peaty soil with rare inclusions of local slate and quartz up to 50mm in size and abundant roots. Contained lithic finds all concentrated at its base."
202,"Trench 2. Natural substrate: mottled, heterogeneous orange-grey-brown silt clay containing abundant poorly sorted fragments pf slate and sandstone up to 0.2m in size. Context is leached in its upper 50-80mm probable due to podsolization processes."
301,"Trench 3. Upper Topsoil: grey, spongey peaty soil containing abundant roots."
302,"Trench 3. Lower topsoil: dark brown-black, homogenous, peaty soil containing rare inclusions of slate and quartz up to 50mm in size. Contained a single flake of worked flint."
303,"Trench 3. Natural substrate: dense, mottled grey-orange silt clay containing rare inclusions of weathered stone up to 30mm in size. This material represents the leached horizon of the natural substrate and was only uncovered in the northern end of the trench in a limited area."
304,"Trench 3. Brown silt-clay, firm, containing abundant, poorly sorted stone inclusions up to 100mm in size. Smaller inclusions appear weathered and decayed. Interpreted as the upper part of the natural substrate, its colour being due to leaching during podsolization processes."
305,"Trench 3. Grey-brown, firm silt-clay containing abundant, poorly-soprted stone inclusions up to 100mm in size and rare flecks of charcoal."
306,"Trench 3. Compact, mottled grey-brown gritty silt clay containing occasional poorly sorted stone inclusions up to 50mm in size. Patches of iron pan are present on the surface. This material is part of the natural substrate, its colour and the iron panning due to podsolization processes."
[307],"Trench 3. Linear cut orientated approximately east-west along the linear depression investigated by trench 3. It has a shallow, open profile and it is not clear if it is anthropogenic and may equally be a water-cut feature."
[308],"Trench 3. Linear cut orientated approximately east-west along the bottom of the linear depression investigated by trench 3. It has a shallow, open profile and it is not clear if it is anthropogenic and may equally be a water-cut feature"
309,Trench3. Brown-grey firm but friable clay-silt containin frequent fragments of orange weathered stone up to 80mm in size.
401,"Trench 4. Upper topsoil: grey-brown, soft peaty soil with abundant roots and rare stone inclusions up to 20mm in size."
402,"Trench 4. Lower topsoil: dark brown-black, firm, peaty soil with occasional roots. Lithics finds were recovered from the deposit’s base."
[403),Trench 4. Stakehole: Roughly circular cut 80mm x 60mm x 50mm deep with a straight-sided profile
404,"Trench 4. Dark brown-black, soft, homogenous clay-silt containing frequent roots."
[405],"Trench 4. Stakehole: broadly circular cut, 60mm in diameter and 50mm deep."
406,"Trench 4. Dark brown-black, soft, homogenous, silt-clay containing frequent root material."
407,"Trench 4. Mottled, brown-grey, firm, clay-silt containing frequent poorly-sorted stone inclusions of local slate and rare ironstone. Inclusions are sub-rounded to sub-angular and up to 0.2m in size with smaller examples being more weathered and degraded. Possible palaeosol"
[408],Trench 4. Roughly oval-shaped cut c.0.6m long by 0.4m wide and 0.15m deep at maximum. Asymmetrical profile with northern edge steeper. Edges show signs of baking and incipient vitrification around entire circumference. On southern edge sides are heavily oxidized. 
[409],Trench 4. Cut truncated by [408]. Remains visible around northern and western edges of [408]. Appears to have had near-vertical sides and flat base according to surviving part.
-410,"Trench 4. Variable, but overall soft, light grey-brown silt-clay."
411,"Trench 4. Heterogeneous fill of [408]. Its upper part consists of a mass of stones (up to 0.1m) in size and baked clay . In lower part it consists predominantly of dark brown clay-silt with abundant charcoal and less stones. Most likely lower and upper part should be divided into two contexts, but it proved difficult to excavated in this way due to poorl;y defined boundary between the two layers and the baked nature of the material. Fill probably represents the remnants of fire lit in [408] which burned at relatively high temperature – sufficient to start to vitrify sides of pit. This was then extinguished by dump of material deposited on top with sufficient residual heat to bake the pit contents in situ."
420,"Trench 4. Natural Substrate. Mottled, firm orange-brown silt-clay overall but variable. Contains occasional to frequent fragments of slate up to 0.2 m in size and poorly-sorted.  May be affected by iron panning as part of podsolization soil formation processes. Interpreted as natural substrate."
[421],Trench 4. Cut with U-shaped profile – not fully excavated but appeared to have baked sides
422,"Trench 4. Red-brown clay-silt containing frequent small stone inclusions giving a slightly gritty feel, occasional stone inclusions up to 50mm and charcoal to 15mm. Column sample taken for micromorphology but otherwise unexcavated."
501,"Trench 5. Upper Topsoil. Dark brown/grey, fairly friable peaty soil – clay silt containing abundant roots."
502,Trench 5. Lower Topsoil. Dark brown/black peaty soil. Denser than (501) but still somewhat friable with frequent roots and rare stone inclusions up to 20mm in size
503,"Trench 5. Natural Substrate. Mottled grey/brown/white clay silt containing abundant slate and sandstone fragments and rare quartz fragments. Inclusions are poorly sorted and up to 0.2m in size. Upper 60mm of layer is leached, below which colour becomes mottled orange-brown suggesting material has been subject to podsolization processes."
